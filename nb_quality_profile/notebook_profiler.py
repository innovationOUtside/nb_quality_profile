# # Notebook Profiles
#
# This exploratory coding notebook explores several techniques to support the static profiling of Jupyter notebooks as texts, reporting on various metrics, including:
#
# - notebook size (markdown and code line counts);
# - readability scores;
# - reading time estimates;
# - code complexity and maintability.
#
# The motivating context was a tool for generating summary reports on the estimated workload associated with 100 or so  notebooks over 25 or so directories (1 directory / 4 notebooks per week) for a third year undergraduate equivalent Open University course on data management and analysis.
#
# Previous notebook recipes include generating simple reports that pull out headings from notebooks to act as notebook summaries (eg [`Get Contents`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/TM351_forum_examples/blob/master/Get%20Contents.ipynb)). Such recipes may provide a useful component in a notebook quality report if the report is also intended to provide a summary / overview of notebooks. (It might be most useful to offer heading summaries as an option in a notebook profiling report?)
#
# Tools supporting the profiling of one or more notebooks across one or more directories and the generation of simple statistics over them are also provided.
#
# The profiler is also capabale of running simple health checks over a notebook, for example reporting on:
#
# - whether code cells have been executed, and if so, whether code cell execution in complete and in linear order;
# - packages / modules loaded in to the notebook;
# - unused code items in a notebook (for example, modules loaded but not used).
#
# Currently, code profiling is only applied to code that appears in code cells, not code that is quoted or described in markdown cells. 
#
# There is a potential for making IPython magics for some of the reporting functions (for example, `radon` or `wily` reports) to provide live feedback / reporting during the creation of content in a notebook.
#
# ### Notebooks
#
# In the first instance, reports are generated for code cell inputs and markdown cells; code outputs and raw cells are not considered. Code appearing in markdown cells is identified as code-like but not analysed in terms of code complexity etc.
#
# For each markdown cell, we can generate a wide range of simple text document statistics. Several packages exist to support such analyses (for example, [`textstat`](https://github.com/shivam5992/textstat), [`readability`](https://github.com/andreasvc/readability/)) but the focus in this notebook will be on metrics derived using the [`spacy`](https://spacy.io/) underpinned [`textacy`](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) package for things like [readability](https://chartbeat-labs.github.io/textacy/api_reference/misc.html?highlight=readability#text-statistics) metrics. Several simple custom metrics are also suggested.
#
# For code in code cells, the [`radon`](https://radon.readthedocs.io) package is used to generate code metrics, with additional packages providing further simple metrics.
#
# A test notebook is provided (`Notebook_profile_test.ipynb`) against which we can test various elements of this notebook.
#
# ### Potential Future Work
#
# In terms of analysing cell outputs (not covered as yet), reports could be generated on the sorts of asset that appear to be displayed in each cell output, whether code warnings or errors are raised, etc. There is also potential for running in association with something like [`nbval`](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) to test that notebooks test correctly against previously run cell outputs.
#
# We might also explore the extent to which interactive notebook profiling tools, such as magics or notebook extensions, be used to support the authoring of new instructional notebooks.
#
# We might also ask to what extent might interactive notebook profiling tools be used to support learners working through instructional material and reflecting on their work? Code health metrics, such as [cell execution success](https://nbgallery.github.io/health_paper.html) used by *nbgallery* may provide clues regarding which code activity cells students struggled to get working, for example. By looking at statistics across students (for example, in assessment notebooks with cell execution success log monitoring enabled) we may be able to identify "healthy" or "unhealthy" activities; for example, a healthy activity is one in which students can get their code to run with one or two tries, an unhealthy activity is one where they make repeated attempts at trying to get the code to work as they desire. 
#
# The notebook profiler should also be runnable against notebooks created using Jupytext from markdown rendered from OU-XML. It would probably make *more* sense to build a custom OU-XML profiler, eg one that could perhaps draw on a summary XML doc generated from OU-XML source docs using XSLT. I'll try to bear in mind creating reporting functions that might be useable in this wider sense. (OU-XML will also have thngs like a/v components, and may have explicit time guidance on expected time spent on particular activities.)
#

# ## Settings
#
# The following parameters are used notebook wide in the generation of reports.

# +
READING_RATE = 100 # words per minute
# What is a sensible reading rate for undergraduate level academic teaching material?
# 250 wpm gives a rate of 15,000 wph
# 10,000 wph corresponds to about 170 words per minute
# OU guidance: 35 wpm for challenging texts, 70 wpm for medium texts, 120 wpm for easy texts

CODE_READING_RATE = 35 # tokens per minute -- UNUSED

CODE_LINE_READING_TIME = 1 # time in seconds to read a code line

LINE_WIDTH = 160 #character width of a line of markdown text; used to calculate "screen lines"

CODE_CELL_REVIEW_TIME = 5 # nominal time in seconds to run each code cell / review each code cell output

CELL_SKIP_TIME = 1 # nomimal time in seconds to move from one cell to the next
# -

# ## Open Notebook
#
# Open and read a notebook, such as the associated test notebook:

import nbformat

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# TEST_NOTEBOOK = 'Notebook_profile_test.ipynb'
# with open(TEST_NOTEBOOK,'r') as f:
#     nb = nbformat.reads(f.read(), as_version=4)
# -

# ## Analyse Markdown Cells
#
# Iterate through markdown cells and generate cell by cell reports.
#
# We can start off by generating some simple counts for a single notebook.
#
# Let's preview the contents of a single cell:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# nb.cells[0]
# -

# We can look at just the markdown component associated with a markdown cell - this will be the basis for our markdown text analysis.

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# txt = nb.cells[0]['source']
# -

# Estimates of reading time are often based on word count estimates. The Medium website use a reading time estimator that also factors in the presence of images in a text as well as wordcount / sentence length. The [`readtime`](https://github.com/alanhamlett/readtime) package uses the Medium reading time estimation algorithm to give a reading time estimate.
#
#
# ?? TO DO - more on the reading time equation; also need something like maybe: +10s for every code cell to run it and look at output? Different reading time per line of code?
#
# *It might be worth looking at forking this reading time estimator and try to factor in reading time elements that reflect the presence of code? Or maybe use a slower reading rate for code? Or factor in code complexity? The presence of links might also affect reading time.*

# The `textacy` package builds on `spacy` to provide a range of higher level tools and statistics, from simple statistics such as word and sentence counts to more complex readability scores using a variety of [readability measures](https://readable.com/blog/the-flesch-reading-ease-and-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/).
#
# One way of using readability measures would be to set reading rates dynamically for each markdown cell based on calculated readability scores.

# #### Code Blocks in Markdown Cells
# A question arises when we have code blocks appearing in markdown cells. How should these be treated? Should we report the code toward markdown counts, or should we separately treat the code, discounting it from markdown word counts but reporting it as "code in markdown"?
#
# Another approach might be to include and codes of block appearing in markdown cells as part of the markdown word count, but provide an additional report identifying how many lines of code appeared as part of the markdown.

# The `excode` package (renamed [`exdown`](https://github.com/nschloe/exdown), now deprecated in favour of [`pytest-codeblocks`](https://github.com/nschloe/pytest-codeblocks/)) provides an easy way of grabbing code blocks from markdown text, so we might be able to use that to mprove the handling of code blocks inside markdown cells.
#
# Could we also just use the detected code in a replace to strip out the code? eg when checking headers?
# Lets grab a simple text case of some markdown containing some code blocks:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# mc = nb.cells[2]['source']

# We could also use the `radon` code analyser (which does count empty lines as code lines unless we explictly strip them).
#
# However, it should be noted that the `radon` code analysis relies on well formed Python code that can be loaded as into the Python AST parser. This means that code that doesn't parse as valid Python, either because it contains an error or because the code is not actually Python code (for example, in course materials we make use of SQL block magic to allow us to write SQL code in a code cell).
#
# The `radon` parser will also report an error if it comes across IPython line or cell magic code, or `!` prefixed shell commands.
#
# We will see later how we can start to cleanse a code string of IPython `!` and `%` prefixed directives when we consider parsing code cells.

# The way we currently process code in markdown cells, it will be timed at the standard reading rate. It may be appropriate to add a simple modifier that also adds a "code reading overhead" to the reading time based on the amount of code in a markdown cell.
#
# For code in code cells, rather than code blocks in markdown cells, might also be worth exploring *code execution time*, that is, an overhead associated with running each code cell. A crude way of calculating this would be to levy a fixed amount of time to account for running the code cell and inspecting the result. A more considered approach would look to cell profiling / execution time logs and code cell outputs in a run notebook.

# ## Reporting Templates
#
# It's all very well having the data in a dataframe, but it could be more useful to be able to generate some written reports. So what might an example report look like?
#
# How about something like:
#
# > In directory X there were N notebooks. The total markdown wordcount for notebooks in the directory was NN. The total number of lines of code across the notebooks was NN. The total estimated reading time across the notebooks was NN.
# >
# > At the notebook level:
# > - notebook A: markdown wordcount NN, lines of code NN, estimated reading time NN;
#
# It might also be useful to provide simple rule (cf. linter rules) that raise warnings about notebooks that go against best practice. For example, notebooks with word counts / code line counts or reading or completion times that exceed recommended limits.

# Let's start with a simple template:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# report_template_simple_md = '''
# In directory `{path}` there were {nb_count} notebooks.
# The total markdown wordcount for the notebooks in the directory was {n_words} words,
# with an estimated total reading time of {reading_time_mins} minutes.
# '''
# -

# We can feed this from a `dict` containing fields required by the report template:

# #%pip install deepmerge
from deepmerge import always_merger


# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# notebook_counts_by_dir = ddf.groupby(['path'])['filename'].nunique().to_dict()

# report_dict = always_merger.merge(ddf_dict, notebook_counts_by_dir )
# for k in report_dict:
#     report_dict[k]['path'] = k
# report_dict

# Feeding the `dict` to the template generates the report:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]

# ### Additional Reporting Levels
# For additional reports, we could start to look for particular grammatical constructions in the markdown text.

# ## Code Cell Analysis
#
# As well as reporting on markdown cells, we can also generate reports on code cells. (We could also use similar techiques to report on code blocks found in markdown cells.)
#
# Possible code cell reports include reporting on:
#
# - packages imported into a notebook;
# - number of lines of code  / code comments;
# - code complexity.
#
# We could also run static analysis tests over *all* the code loaded into a notebook, for example using things like [`importchecker`](https://github.com/zopefoundation/importchecker) to check that imports are actually used.
#
# Checks against whether code cells in a notebooks: a) have been run; b) whether they have been run in order are also possible. If we extend the analysis to code cell outputs, we could also report on whether cells had been run without warning or error and what sort of output they produced.
#
# Tools such as [`pyflakes`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) can also be used to run a wider range of static tests over a codebase, as can other code linters. See also [*Thinking About Things That Might Be Autogradeable or Useful for Automated Marking Support*](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/12/10/thinking-about-things-that-might-be-autogradeable/) for examples of tests that may be used in autograding, some of which might also be useful for notebook code profiling.
#
# It might also be worth trying to collate possible useful guidelines / heuristics / rules of thumb for creating notebooks that could also provide the basis of quality minded linting checks.
#
# For example:
#
# - a markdown cell should always appear before a code cells to set the context for what the code cell is expected to achieve;
# - a markdown cell commenting on the output of a code cell immediately preceding may be appropriate in some cases;
# - one cell should be defined per code cell. A markdown cell immediately following a code cell that defines a function might include a line of text that might also serve as the function doc text, describing what the function does an dprefacing a code cell that demonstrates the behaviour of the function.

# ### Generating code reports over a single notebook
#
# Let's start to put together some metrics we can run against code cells, either at an individual level or from code aggregated from across all the code cells in a notebook.

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# c='''#print\nimport pandas\n\nprint('a')\nimport abjad\nimport numpy as np\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, JSON'''
#
# #https://github.com/andrewp-as-is/list-imports.py #list imports
# #%pip install list-imports
# import list_imports
# list_imports.parse(c)
# #Would also need to capture magics?
#
# # TO DO  - NOT CURRENTLY REPORTED
# -

# Some utilities may not make sense in the reporting when applied at a cell level. For example, it's quite likely that a package imported into a cell may not be used in that cell, which `pyflakes` would report unfavourably on:

# +
# #%pip install pyflakes
#pyflakes seems to print the report, so we'd need to find a way to capture it
from pyflakes.api import check
from pyflakes.reporter import Reporter

import io


# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# output_w = io.StringIO()
# output_e = io.StringIO()
#
# check('''import pandas as pd''', 'dummy', Reporter(output_w, output_e))
# output_w.getvalue()
# -

# Another form of analysis that only makes sense at the notebook level is the code cell execution analysis:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# # Check execution across notebook - TO DO - NOT CURRENTLY REPORTED
# cell_execution_order = []
# num_code_cells = 0
# for cell in nb.cells:
#     if cell['cell_type']=='code':
#         cell_execution_order.append(cell['execution_count'])
#         num_code_cells = num_code_cells + 1
#
#
# _executed_cells = [i for i in cell_execution_order if i is not None and isinstance(i,int) ]
# in_order_execution = _executed_cells == sorted(_executed_cells)
#
# all_cells_executed = len(_executed_cells)==num_code_cells
# print(cell_execution_order, all_cells_executed, in_order_execution,)
# -

# ### Parsing IPython Code
#
# One thing to bear in mind is that code cells may contain block magic that switches code from the assumed default Python code to potentially a different language. For this reason, we might want to fall back from the `radon` metrics as a result of trying to load code into a Python AST parser when meeting cells that employ cell block magic, or explore whether an IPyhton parser could be used instead.

# Let's try to cleanse IPython directives such as shell commands (`!` prefix) or magics (`%` prefix) from a code string so that we can present it to `radon`.

def sanitise_IPython_code(c):
    """Cleanse an IPython code string so we can parse it with radon."""
    #Comment out magic and shell commands
    c = '\n'.join([f'#{_r}' if _r.lstrip().startswith(('%','!')) else _r for _r in c.splitlines()])
    
    return c


# The `sanitise_IPython_code()` function partially sanitises an IPython code string so that it can be passed to, and parsed by, the `radon`. Note that where magic or shell statements are used on the right hand side of an assignment statement, this will still cause an error. 

#Use the `radon` analyzer
# #%pip install radon
from radon.raw import analyze


# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# c = '''%load_ext magic\nimport pandas\n\n!ls\nprint(a)'''
# c = sanitise_IPython_code(c)

#     n_single_line_comment_code_lines, n_code_lines = r_analyze(sanitise_IPython_code(c))
#
# n_total_code_lines, n_blank_code_lines, n_single_line_comment_code_lines, n_code_lines
# -

# To parse a code cell, we can try to use the `radon` analyser, with a sanitised code string, or fall back to using the simpler code sanitiser. It will also be convenient to return the results as a Python `dict` object.

# ## Visualising Notebook Structure
#
# To provide a glanceable, macroscopic way of comparing the size and structure of multiple notebooks, we can generate a simple visualisation based on screen line counts and colour codes for different cell types or cell state.
#
# Reports that include cell index and a simple line count (for example, reprting the number of code lines or screen lines for markdown) can be rendered directly as linear visualisations showing the overall structure of a notebook. 
#
# For example:
#
# - markdown: header;
# - markdown: paragraph;
# - markdown: code block;
# - markdown: blank line;
# - code: code;
# - code: comment;
# - code: magic;
# - code: blank line;
# - other: other cells.
#
# To profile within a cell requires access to cell internals, or generating a cell profile during cell processing.
#
# However, it's easy enough to generate a view over the code and markdown cells.
#
# Let's start by exploring a simple representation:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# ax.axis('off')
#
# #Simple representation of lines per cell and cell colour based on cell type
# n_c = [(1,'r'),(2,'pink'), (1,'cornflowerblue'), (2,'pink')]
#
# x=0
# y=0
#
# for _n_c in n_c:
#     _y = y + _n_c[0]
#     plt.plot([x,x], [y,_y], _n_c[1], linewidth=5)
#     y = _y   #may want to add a gap when moving from one cell to next
# plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
# -

# We can get the list of cell size and colour tuples from a notebook's report data frame:

# +
VIS_COLOUR_MAP  = {'md':'cornflowerblue','code':'pink'}

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# report.apply(cell_attrib, axis=1).to_list()

# ## Checking Notebook Metrics Evolution Over Time
#
# The `wily` package uses `radon` to produce code quality reports across a git repository history and generate charts showin the evolution of metrics over the lifetime of a repository. This suggests various corollaries:
#
# - could we generate `wily` style measures over the recent history of a notebook code cell?
# - could we generate `wily` style temporal measures over all the reports (markdown text, as well as code) generated from a notebook across several commits of it to a git repository.

# ## Other Cell Analysis
#
# As a placeholder, should we also at least report on a count of cells that are note code or markdown cells?
#
# Also a count of empty cells?
#
# Is this moving towards some sort of notebook linter?
