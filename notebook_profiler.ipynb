    "# Notebook Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory coding notebook explores several techniques to support the static profiling of Jupyter notebooks as texts, reporting on various metrics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- notebook size (markdown and code line counts);\n",
    "- readability scores;\n",
    "- reading time estimates;\n",
    "- code complexity and maintability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivating context was a tool for generating summary reports on the estimated workload associated with 100 or so  notebooks over 25 or so directories (1 directory / 4 notebooks per week) for a third year undergraduate equivalent Open University course on data management and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous notebook recipes include generating simple reports that pull out headings from notebooks to act as notebook summaries (eg [`Get Contents`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/TM351_forum_examples/blob/master/Get%20Contents.ipynb)). Such recipes may provide a useful component in a notebook quality report if the report is also intended to provide a summary / overview of notebooks. (It might be most useful to offer heading summaries as an option in a notebook profiling report?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools supporting the profiling of one or more notebooks across one or more directories and the generation of simple statistics over them are also provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler is also capabale of running simple health checks over a notebook, for example reporting on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- whether code cells have been executed, and if so, whether code cell execution in complete and in linear order;\n",
    "- packages / modules loaded in to the notebook;\n",
    "- unused code items in a notebook (for example, modules loaded but not used).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, code profiling is only applied to code that appears in code cells, not code that is quoted or described in markdown cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a potential for making IPython magics for some of the reporting functions (for example, `radon` or `wily` reports) to provide live feedback / reporting during the creation of content in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first instance, reports are generated for code cell inputs and markdown cells; code outputs and raw cells are not considered. Code appearing in markdown cells is identified as code-like but not analysed in terms of code complexity etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each markdown cell, we can generate a wide range of simple text document statistics. Several packages exist to support such analyses (for example, [`textstat`](https://github.com/shivam5992/textstat), [`readability`](https://github.com/andreasvc/readability/)) but the focus in this notebook will be on metrics derived using the [`spacy`](https://spacy.io/) underpinned [`textacy`](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) package for things like [readability](https://chartbeat-labs.github.io/textacy/api_reference/misc.html?highlight=readability#text-statistics) metrics. Several simple custom metrics are also suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code in code cells, the [`radon`](https://radon.readthedocs.io) package is used to generate code metrics, with additional packages providing further simple metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test notebook is provided (`Notebook_profile_test.ipynb`) against which we can test various elements of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of analysing cell outputs (not covered as yet), reports could be generated on the sorts of asset that appear to be displayed in each cell output, whether code warnings or errors are raised, etc. There is also potential for running in association with something like [`nbval`](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) to test that notebooks test correctly against previously run cell outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also explore the extent to which interactive notebook profiling tools, such as magics or notebook extensions, be used to support the authoring of new instructional notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also ask to what extent might interactive notebook profiling tools be used to support learners working through instructional material and reflecting on their work? Code health metrics, such as [cell execution success](https://nbgallery.github.io/health_paper.html) used by *nbgallery* may provide clues regarding which code activity cells students struggled to get working, for example. By looking at statistics across students (for example, in assessment notebooks with cell execution success log monitoring enabled) we may be able to identify \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy\" activities; for example, a healthy activity is one in which students can get their code to run with one or two tries, an unhealthy activity is one where they make repeated attempts at trying to get the code to work as they desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook profiler should also be runnable against notebooks created using Jupytext from markdown rendered from OU-XML. It would probably make *more* sense to build a custom OU-XML profiler, eg one that could perhaps draw on a summary XML doc generated from OU-XML source docs using XSLT. I'll try to bear in mind creating reporting functions that might be useable in this wider sense. (OU-XML will also have thngs like a/v components, and may have explicit time guidance on expected time spent on particular activities.)\n"

    "Checks against whether code cells in a notebooks: a) have been run; b) whether they have been run in order are also possible. If we extend the analysis to code cell outputs, we could also report on whether cells had been run without warning or error and what sort of output they produced.\n",

    "- one cell should be defined per code cell. A markdown cell immediately following a code cell that defines a function might include a line of text that might also serve as the function doc text, describing what the function does an dprefacing a code cell that demonstrates the behaviour of the function."
